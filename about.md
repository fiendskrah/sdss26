# About 

The Spatial Data Science Summit will convene researchers, developers, educators, and community leaders to discuss opportunities and challenges in building a more open, interoperable, and sustainable geospatial ecosystem. The subsequent AAG panels will extend these conversations to a broader disciplinary audience, highlighting practices and pathways for advancing open science within geography and spatial data science.


The Spatial Data Science Summit at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) on March 15–16, 2025 will be followed by a series of panels on Open Source Spatial Data Science at the 2025 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Geographers (AAG), taking place March 17–22, 2025, in San Francisco, California.
